# sam-irc-nodejs
A Node.js/Electron mini-IRC client/server to say "Hello world" !

## Which purpose?
The first purpose of this work is to (re)discover node.js, electron, and all the other frameworks needed 
to be able, in less than one month, of writting a multi-platforms desktop application connected to a remote/local server. 
So it can be resumed as **learning** node.js.

In a first time, this work is part of a school project named SAM-Solution ([link to the github group](https://github.com/EIP-SAM)), 
fitting into the Epitech Innovative Project program ([EIP](http://www.epitech.eu/epitech-innovative-projects.aspx)). 

In a second time, this work is also a good start for an other school project, that is a web corewar ([link to the github group](https://github.com/MIT-Niceti)).
This other project fits in my international exchange program, between Epitech and the Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT).

The second purpose of this work, as you can see by reading this readme, is **demonstration**.
